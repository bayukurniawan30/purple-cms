# Quick Start

It's recommended to install Purple CMS by cloning the Purple CMS repository on Github

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bayukurniawan30/purple-cms.git
```

Or you can download the zip file. Extract all the files to your server. If you want to install it locally, for example XAMPP or LAMPP, create a folder inside htdocs folder and extract the zip file. Next, install dependencies by composer, you have to use composer, because composer will install all dependencies automatically. If you don't have a composer yet, download [here](https://getcomposer.org/)

```bash
composer install
```
If the installation process is successful, open the link below in your web browser.

```http
http://<hostname>/setup
```

Or if you install Purple CMS in local server

```http
http://localhost/<folder-name>/setup
```

<p class="tip">Substituting <code>&lt;hostname&gt;</code> with your web serverâ€™s host name, and <code>&lt;folder-name&gt;</code> is where you installed Purple CMS in local server.</p>
