# Headless CMS - Enable Headless CMS

You can create Collections and Singletons by default, but you can also enable Headless CMS feature in to change Dashboard view.

To enable Headless CMS, go to **Settings** â†’ **General**. Scroll down until you see Headless Settings. In the **Set This Website as Headless CMS** option, change the value to **Yes**. For **Front End Website** option, set the value to your front-end website url.

Now if you go to Dashboard page, you will see the Visitors stats change to Headless stats. Front-end page (Your Purple CMS homepage) also change.

<p class="tip">If you enable Headless CMS feature, visitors data won't count. Use third party service like <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/">Google Analytics</a> in your Front-End to get visitors data.</p>
