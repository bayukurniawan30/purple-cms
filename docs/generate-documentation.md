# Generate Documentation {docsify-ignore-all}

Purple CMS Documentation is made by [docsify, A magical documentation site generator](https://docsify.js.org/#/). The documentation files are located in the **docs** folder.

It is recommended to install <code>docsify-cli</code> globally, which helps initializing and previewing the website locally.

```bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

Run the local server with docsify serve. You can preview your site in your browser on <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. Run command below in docs folder.

```bash
docsify serve
```

<p class="tip">You can run <code>docsify serve</code> from Visual Studio Code Terminal</p>
